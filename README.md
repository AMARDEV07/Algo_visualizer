## 🔧 Features

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (with sorted input)

### 🔃 Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

## 📁 Project Structure

├── index.html # Main HTML file (UI structure)
├── style.css # Styling for visual components and layout
├── script.js # JavaScript logic for animations and algorithms
├── images.png # Preview image for project interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Markup structure of the web page
- **CSS3** – Custom styling for the UI components
- **JavaScript** – Core logic for visualizing searching and sorting algorithms

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the visualizer locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algo-visualizer.git

2.  Navigate into the project
cd algo-visualizer
Open in Browser

Just double-click on index.html, or open it via any browser.


🧩 How It Works
Input an array or generate a random one.
Select the algorithm you want to visualize.
Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
Elements are animated step-by-step to show each pass or comparison.
you can stop animation in mid or u can add custom input according your chooise
 Add more advanced algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

✅ Add user input customization for array size and speed
✅ Include time & space complexity display
✅ Responsive design for mobile viewing
